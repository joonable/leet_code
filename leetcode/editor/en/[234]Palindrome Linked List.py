# Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or 
# false otherwise. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
# Output: true
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: false
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  0 <= Node.val <= 9 
#  
# 
#  
# Follow up: Could you do it in 
# O(n) time and 
# O(1) space?
