# Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If 
# there is no cycle, return null. 
# 
#  There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can 
# be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is 
# used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0
# -indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a 
# parameter. 
# 
#  Do not modify the linked list. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: tail connects to node index 1
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the 
# second node.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: tail connects to node index 0
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the 
# first node.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
#  
#  
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: no cycle
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Åµ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#  pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

        I used Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare algorithm.
        One pointer moves twice as fast as the other.
        If there‚Äôs a cycle, they‚Äôll meet inside the cycle.
        Then I reset one pointer to the head, and move both one step at a time.
