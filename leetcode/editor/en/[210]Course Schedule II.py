# There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to 
# numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai,
#  bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
#  
# 
#  
#  For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to 
# first take course 1. 
#  
# 
#  Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If 
# there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all 
# courses, return an empty array. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you 
# should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
# Output: [0,2,1,3]
# Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you 
# should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken 
# after you finished course 0.
# So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3
# ].
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
# Output: [0]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= numCourses <= 2000 
#  0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1) 
#  prerequisites[i].length == 2 
#  0 <= ai, bi < numCourses 
#  ai != bi 
#  All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct.
