# Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. 
# 
#  The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the 
# square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to 
# be a positive integer. 
# 
#  You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra 
# white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume 
# that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for 
# those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4]. 
# 
#  The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never 
# exceed 10‚Åµ. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
# Output: "aaabcbc"
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
# Output: "accaccacc"
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
# Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= s.length <= 30 
#  s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets '[]'. 
#  s is guaranteed to be a valid input. 
#  All the integers in s are in the range [1, 300].
