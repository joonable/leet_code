# Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth. 
# 
#  A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path 
# from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 3
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [1,null,2]
# Output: 2
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -100 <= Node.val <= 100
