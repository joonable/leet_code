# Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-
# decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target 
# number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1
#  < index2 <= numbers.length. 
# 
#  Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an 
# integer array [index1, index2] of length 2. 
# 
#  The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not 
# use the same element twice. 
# 
#  Your solution must use only constant extra space. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We 
# return [1, 2].
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,3]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We 
# return [1, 3].
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We 
# return [1, 2].
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10⁴ 
#  -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000 
#  numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order. 
#  -1000 <= target <= 1000 
#  The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
