# You are given a string s, which contains stars *. 
# 
#  In one operation, you can: 
# 
#  
#  Choose a star in s. 
#  Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the 
# star itself. 
#  
# 
#  Return the string after all stars have been removed. 
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible. 
#  It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
# Output: "lecoe"
# Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
# - The closest character to the 1À¢·µó star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes 
# "lee*cod*e".
# - The closest character to the 2‚Åø·µà star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes 
# "lecod*e".
# - The closest character to the 3 ≥·µà star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes 
# "lecoe".
# There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe". 
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "erase*****"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= s.length <= 10‚Åµ 
#  s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *. 
#  The operation above can be performed on s.
