# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search 
# tree (BST). 
# 
#  A valid BST is defined as follows: 
# 
#  
#  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the 
# node's key. 
#  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the 
# node's key. 
#  Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: true
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -2¬≥¬π <= Node.val <= 2¬≥¬π - 1
